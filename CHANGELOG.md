## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-05 (RC-5.3 — Correctness, Audit Integrity, and Release Gating)

RC-5.3 is a correctness and hardening release on top of the RC-5.2 composer
train. It carries one new composer capability (operator-set sampling), tightens
the release pipeline so images cannot publish ahead of their required checks,
and lands a broad body of audit-integrity, trust-tier, output-contract, and
frontend recovery fixes. The theme is evidence integrity under failure: audit
rows are no longer written before the work they describe is real, output
contracts reject sparse or malformed rows at the sink boundary rather than
downstream, trust-tier error semantics raise typed faults instead of crashing
or fabricating, and the web composer no longer renders stale responses after
navigation. No schema migrations are introduced.

### Added

- **Operator-set sampling configuration (ADR-027)** — the web composer now
  sources its LLM sampling parameters from operator-set configuration rather
  than per-call defaults, threaded through the guided chain/chat solvers, the
  boot probe, and auto-title. The `ComposerLLMCall` audit contract records the
  resolved sampling so an auditor can reconstruct exactly how each model call
  was parameterised. See
  `docs/architecture/adr/027-composer-operator-set-sampling.md`.
- **Release required-checks gate** — `scripts/cicd/check_release_required_checks.py`
  gates container-image publication in `build-push.yaml` on the release's
  required checks having passed, so an image can no longer be pushed ahead of
  its CI evidence.
- **Large-scale checkpoint policy** — documented checkpoint behaviour for
  large-scale runs (`docs/reference/configuration.md`, the
  `examples/large_scale_test` settings) with a policy test pinning it.
- **OpenRouter catalog source check** — Landscape database-compatibility guards
  now require an OpenRouter catalog source check before relying on catalog
  provenance.

### Changed

- **Trust-tier branch-join correctness** — the `tier_model` rule and its
  `trust_boundary` suppression now resolve branch joins correctly; the
  `core` / `plugins` / `web` enforce-tier allowlists were reconciled to match.
- **Fail closed on conflicting original headers** — `display_headers` now fails
  closed when original headers conflict instead of silently picking one.
- **Stale allowlists fail the gate** — non-tier stale allowlist entries now fail
  CI rather than passing silently.
- **Repo hygiene** — `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are no longer tracked; the
  session hook regenerates them on disk, so tracking them only produced
  perpetual churn.

### Fixed

#### Audit integrity and determinism

- **Artifact streaming verifies bytes against the audit hash** before streaming,
  so a tampered or truncated artifact cannot be served as audited evidence.
- **Composer MCP delete preserves audit history** rather than dropping the
  delete from the trail.
- **`resolved_prompt_template_hash` is preserved** across the read and export
  surfaces; the Landscape prompt-hash anchor is validated *before* insert so no
  bad row is ever committed.
- **SSRF-safe request success is recorded outside the network try** to avoid a
  duplicate audit row; empty-corpus Chroma retrievals are now recorded in the
  audit trail.
- **Replayer sequence advances only after a concrete result**, and failed-run
  accounting is hydrated when the data is available.

#### Output contracts and sink/source boundaries

- **Sparse-field output contracts** fixed for Azure Blob, Dataverse, and
  `JSONSource`; the narrative-summary transform's output contract is corrected.
- **Custom CSV headers are enforced completely** for the CSV and Azure Blob
  sinks; Azure Blob CSV custom headers are honoured.
- **Sink write safety** — the database sink enforces target-table compatibility
  before appending, the Chroma sink preflights a full batch for duplicates
  before any add (error mode), the JSON sink rolls back its array buffer on a
  failed write, and Chroma persistent sink paths are guarded.
- **Dataverse rejects OData-unsafe lookup bind values** at the sink boundary.

#### Trust-tier and web error semantics

- **Web session Tier-1 error semantics** now raise typed, upstream-interpretable
  errors instead of crashing or coercing.
- **Composer routes surface the provider detail** on a bad request, and the boot
  probe bounds its transient handling.
- **Redaction masks both the path and file blob storage-path carriers**, closing
  a storage-path leak.

#### Web composer recovery and stale-response guards

- Guarded stale responses across session selection, navigation, blob loads,
  execution-start, YAML refetch, and run-outputs artifact state; guided turn
  widgets remount on payload changes; blob and secret stores clear on logout;
  loop closure during progress scheduling is treated as shutdown; shared-inspect
  401 auth is preserved.

#### Sessions, Landscape, and CI/CD

- **Session index/constraint validation** checks column *sets*, not just names.
- **Landscape read-only mode** keeps live WAL audit DBs visible.
- **CI/CD gate repairs** — restored the adapter-budget gate, repaired the
  cicd-judge gates and cleared stale judge allowlist blockers, refreshed judge
  signatures for RC5.3 allowlist drift, narrowed `fingerprint_params` to a
  scalar value type to green `check_contracts`, fixed staging web-unit safety
  flags, and aligned release-PDF distribution labels.

> **Known issue at release cut.** `test_baseline_capture_is_self_consistent`
> is red at the RC-5.3 HEAD: `tests/unit/elspeth_lints/fixtures/fingerprint_baseline.json` drifted
> (+6 raw `trust_tier.tier_model` findings) as RC-5.3 commits landed without the
> mechanical baseline regeneration. Regenerating it safely requires the
> operator-held `ELSPETH_JUDGE_METADATA_HMAC_KEY` to confirm the enforce gate is
> green first, so it is deferred to an operator step before the release is
> tagged.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-19 (RC-5.2 — Guided Composer, Durable Progress, and Recovery UX)

RC-5.2 is the large Web Composer release train that folds the guided-mode
wizard, composer progress persistence, manifest-keyed redaction, per-step chat,
chat-as-data-entry, interpretation review, shareable completion gestures,
frontend recovery UX, CI/CD gate consolidation, release-documentation refreshes,
and RC5.2 hardening back onto `main`. It moves the composer from a best-effort
interactive surface toward an audited, recoverable authoring system: model
calls, tool dispatch, redacted tool payloads, persisted transcript rows,
interpretation decisions, recovery diffs, and operator-visible failure causes
now share one evidence story.

### Added

#### Composer Guided Mode

- **Composer guided mode** — new structured-protocol wizard for first-time
  pipeline authors. Source → sink → transforms in three steps; closed
  six-turn taxonomy; deterministic recipe pre-match; LLM-read-only with
  respect to pipeline state. Ships alongside the unmodified freeform
  composer; mode transition uses progressive disclosure.
  See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-composer-guided-mode-design.md`.
- **ComposerLLMCall audit channel** — every `solve_chain` invocation in
  guided mode now records a `ComposerLLMCall` audit row (provider, model,
  status, latency, prompt/completion tokens). Pairs with the existing
  `ComposerToolInvocation` audit channel so an auditor can reconstruct
  both what the model was asked and what tools it then dispatched.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 1A (schema)

- **`chat_messages` audit columns** — `tool_call_id`, `sequence_no`,
  `writer_principal`, `parent_assistant_id` are now required by the
  schema, with biconditional CHECK constraints
  (`ck_chat_messages_tool_call_id_role`, `ck_chat_messages_parent_role`)
  pinning the OpenAI-shaped tool-call linkage. `role` now permits the
  `audit` value alongside the prior four for breadcrumb rows that have
  no parent assistant.
- **`composition_states.provenance` column** — every composition-state
  write declares one of `tool_call`, `convergence_persist`,
  `plugin_crash_persist`, `preflight_persist`, `session_seed`,
  `session_fork`. The enum is enforced by
  `ck_composition_states_provenance`.
- **`run_events` table** — new SQLAlchemy table for per-run event
  records (`progress` / `error` / `completed` / `cancelled` / `failed`)
  with `ck_run_events_type` CHECK.
- **`audit_access_log` table** — scaffolded INERT for Phase 3+
  read-side audit (`requesting_principal`, `request_path`,
  `query_args`, `ip_address`, `writer_principal`).
- **Per-session indices** — `ix_audit_access_log_session_timestamp`
  and new partial uniqueness on `chat_messages(session_id, sequence_no)`.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 1B (single-transaction primitive)

- **`SessionServiceImpl.persist_compose_turn` / `persist_compose_turn_async`** —
  new single-transaction primitive that writes assistant message,
  redacted tool rows, and composition state atomically. Sync primitive
  for in-thread tests; async wrapper for production.
  See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-composer-progress-persistence-design.md`.
- **`_persist_payload.py` DTOs** — `StatePayload`, `_ToolOutcome`,
  `RedactedToolRow`, `AuditOutcome` formalize the turn payload shape.
- **Advisory-lock primitive** — `contracts/advisory_locks.py` typed
  helpers; Postgres `pg_advisory_xact_lock` for cross-session
  serialization, SQLite per-session `RLock` for testcontainer parity.
- **Sequence-number reservation** — `_reserve_sequence_range` allocates
  a contiguous `sequence_no` block under the session write lock to
  preserve per-session monotonicity under concurrent writers.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 1C (Postgres portability lane)

- **Testcontainer-backed integration tests** — a new `@pytest.mark.testcontainer`
  lane spins up an ephemeral Postgres container per test. Exercises
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` semantics, commit-wins concurrency, and
  Postgres-specific blob `ready_hash` partial uniqueness that SQLite
  cannot model. `psycopg2-binary` and `testcontainers[postgres]` are
  shipped as opt-in deps.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 2 (redaction walker + MANIFEST)

- **Redaction walker** — `web/composer/redaction.py` grew from a
  42-line stub to a 2,752-line walker. Recursively descends LLM-supplied
  argument and response payloads, applies `Sensitive[T]` typed markers
  with per-field summarizers, and produces a redacted payload safe for
  Tier-1 audit storage and Tier-3 LLM echo.
- **38-entry MANIFEST** — every composer tool now has an explicit
  redaction policy: 10 type-driven entries with Pydantic argument
  models (`CreateBlobArgumentsModel`, `UpdateBlobArgumentsModel`,
  `SetSourceArgumentsModel`, `SetSourceFromBlobArgumentsModel`,
  `SetPipelineArgumentsModel`, `ApplyPipelineRecipeArgumentsModel`,
  `PatchSourceOptionsArgumentsModel`, `PatchNodeOptionsArgumentsModel`,
  `PatchOutputOptionsArgumentsModel`) plus 28 declarative entries for
  discovery and inspection tools.
- **Pydantic-first ARG_ERROR routing** — promoted tools now validate
  arguments via their argument model first; `pydantic.ValidationError`
  is re-raised as `ToolArgumentError` so the compose loop's ARG_ERROR
  channel receives the right exception class. LLM-facing error message
  names the argument-bundle + model name only, never per-field detail
  (rev-2 BLOCKER_A leak discipline). Structured Pydantic detail
  survives on `__cause__` for auditors via
  `canonicalize_pydantic_cause`.
- **Adequacy guard** — `test_adequacy_guard.py` pins manifest-registry
  parity (every registered tool must have a MANIFEST entry) and a
  byte-identical redaction snapshot (`redaction_policy_snapshot.json`).
  Any MANIFEST change must regenerate the snapshot via
  `scripts/cicd/bootstrap_redaction_snapshot.py`.
- **F1–F6 hardening** — completeness Hypothesis property tests,
  walker-guard parity, summarizer contract Hypothesis, label-gate
  CI workflow, drift guards for Hypothesis strategy overrides.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 3 (compose loop persistence)

- **Atomic compose-loop tool turns** — `_compose_loop` now persists assistant
  messages, tool-call breadcrumbs, redacted tool payloads, and composition-state
  snapshots through `persist_compose_turn`, preserving the audit-first contract
  even when tools fail, cancellation lands mid-turn, or a plugin crash triggers
  recovery handling.
- **Per-turn tool-call cap** — composer turns enforce a bounded tool-call count
  and emit a `tool_call_cap_exceeded` reason code instead of allowing unbounded
  tool recursion.
- **Audit-grade transcript access** — session message reads can opt into
  `include_tool_rows=true` and record access through `audit_access_log`, giving
  auditors a path to reconstruct tool rows without exposing them in normal chat
  history.
- **Compose-loop invariant coverage** — property and integration tests now pin
  audit counter conservation, manifest redaction, cancellation commit windows,
  failed-turn tool-response counts, no-op behaviour, and the compose-loop
  persistence harness.

#### Composer Progress Persistence — Phase 4 (frontend recovery)

- **Recovery panel** — the frontend now detects recoverable composer failures
  and opens a dedicated recovery surface with the assistant transcript, redacted
  tool rows, and before/after state diff for operator inspection.
- **Recovery transcript and diff rendering** — recovery payloads are parsed,
  stored in the session store, fetched with `include_tool_rows=true`, and
  rendered through focused `RecoveryTranscript`, `RecoveryDiff`, and
  `RecoveryPanel` components.
- **Frontend lint gate** — the frontend package now ships an ESLint config and
  `npm run lint` gate so recovery/guided-mode UI changes have a static quality
  check alongside tests, typecheck, and build.

#### RC5.2 Hotfix Integration

- **Auth and audit hardening** — local/Entra auth flows now audit token
  issuance, auth failure classes, local login outcomes, refresh-provider
  invariants, provider outages, and web-run attribution into Landscape while
  redacting JWKS failure detail and suppressing token-response caching.
- **Execution and validation hardening** — web execution now classifies
  validation errors, sanitizes broad execution errors, persists resolved run
  config, rejects misplaced secret refs, and preserves guided audit persistence
  failures.
- **Engine/plugin correctness fixes** — checkpoint resume parsing, empty
  coalesce checkpoint state, pending batch row identities, JSON sink parent
  creation, sink preflight collision timing, Web Scrape fail-closed boundaries,
  LLM provider preflight, and shared LLM telemetry helpers were tightened.
- **Frontend accessibility and theming fixes** — guided/catalog/run UI now has
  improved contrast, forced-colors fallbacks, theme initialization and cross-tab
  sync, screen-reader-safe status symbols, catalog retry controls, keyboard
  shortcut support, and preserved plugin descriptions.

#### Composer UX Redesign, Preferences, and Review Flow

- **Composer preferences** — new user preferences schema, service, routes, and
  frontend defaults let users choose their composer starting mode, with review
  follow-up hardening for backend validation, frontend error surfacing, and
  preference write-failure alerts.
- **Chat as data entry** — short chat inputs can project into audited inline
  blob sources with source provenance, hash evidence, MIME parsing, ambiguity
  handling, fallback prompts, and audit-readiness panel support.
- **LLM interpretation review** — ambiguous prompt-template decisions can now
  pause for operator review, persist append-only interpretation events, support
  opt-out, gate execution while unresolved reviews remain, and show guided and
  freeform review widgets in the chat surface.
- **Completion gestures and shareable reviews** — composer sessions gained
  completion events, HMAC-signed shareable review links, YAML-export audit
  events, narrative result views, save-for-review dialogs, shared inspection
  views, and reusable frontend primitives for completion flows.
- **First-run tutorial and mode guidance** — the Phase 4 tutorial introduces
  the composer through a hello-world path, persistent tutorial state, cache-skip
  telemetry, and explicit guidance for switching between freeform and guided
  authoring.
- **Catalog reshape and audit-readiness UI** — plugin catalog cards, filters,
  audit characteristics, inline chat-source entry, SideRail audit status, graph
  and YAML modals, validation suggestions, and modal focus traps were rebuilt
  around the new composer information architecture.

#### Engine, Transform, and Plugin Additions

- **Batch-aware aggregation context** — transforms can receive
  `AggregationBatchContext`, enabling the new `report_assemble` transform with
  end-to-end pipeline coverage, metadata-collision checks, and documentation.
- **Composer knob schema lowering** — plugin option metadata now lowers into
  one-knob composer schemas, with discriminated plugin protocol support,
  visible-when scope guards, recipe-slot adapters, golden catalog coverage, and
  config-metadata enforcement.
- **Determinism declaration enforcement** — plugin infrastructure now enforces
  determinism declarations mechanically via `__init_subclass__`, with catalog
  and boundary-classification follow-up coverage.

#### CI, Lints, and Release Documentation

- **`elspeth-lints` static analyzer** — custom CI analyzers moved into the
  `elspeth-lints` package with rule fixtures, parity harnesses, emitters, SARIF
  output, ADR-023, rule-author documentation, and migrated tests for composer,
  contract, audit-evidence, immutability, manifest, and trust-tier rules.
- **CI/CD master-plan consolidation** — CI now gates RC branches, consolidates
  static analysis, runs CodeQL, checks dependency/license state, gates
  Playwright E2E as a required signal, and carries branch-protection runbooks
  plus allowlist audit findings.
- **Telemetry backfill trailer enforcement** — commit hooks and GitHub Actions
  now enforce cohort-attribution trailers for commits touching telemetry
  backfill surfaces.
- **Release docs and docs cleanout** — RC-1/RC-2 changelog fragments,
  superseded release snapshots, frozen architecture packs, generated reviews,
  and completed handover corpora were moved to the dated
  `docs-archive/2026-05-19-docs-cleanout/` archive with a manifest, while
  current release, executive, progress, velocity, assurance, composer evidence,
  and audit documents stay linked from `docs/README.md`.
- **PDF tooling hygiene** — generated PDF output now defaults under
  `tools/pdf/out/`, with build scripts and docs updated so generated artifacts
  no longer pollute tracked documentation paths.

### Changed

- **`SessionServiceImpl.add_message()` requires `writer_principal=`** —
  one of `compose_loop`, `route_user_message`, `route_system_message`,
  `admin_tool`, `session_fork`. Enforced by `ck_chat_messages_writer_principal`.
- **`SessionServiceImpl.save_composition_state()` requires `provenance=`** —
  one of the 6 values above. Enforced by `ck_composition_states_provenance`.
- **`SessionServiceImpl.__init__()` requires `telemetry=` and `log=`** —
  callers construct via `build_sessions_telemetry()` from
  `web/sessions/telemetry.py`.
- **Composer chain-solver tool response shape** — guided-mode chain
  solver now constrains tool response shape and surfaces malformed
  responses via the auto-drop channel rather than masking them.
- **Exit-from-COMPLETED terminal returns 200** — guided sessions in
  `kind=completed` terminal accept `control_signal=exit_to_freeform`
  via POST `/api/sessions/{id}/guided/respond` and transition to
  `kind=exited_to_freeform` (previously returned 409).
- **Per-step guided chat** — guided mode now has a separate per-step advisory
  chat channel with persisted `chat_history`, `ComposerChatTurn` audit rows,
  route-level invariant auditing, and a `GuidedChatHistory` frontend component.
- **Guided-mode prompt loading** — the guided composer skill pack is split into
  base plus step-specific prompt files, preserving the deployment overlay and
  allowing step-scoped context without flattening all guidance into one prompt.
- **Finite status typing** — MCP finite status fields and guided wire shapes use
  narrower literals/enums, with cross-language SlotType drift checked by CI.
- **Composer dependency packaging** — `chromadb`, `html2text`, and
  `beautifulsoup4` are mandatory dependencies rather than optional `rag` / `web`
  extras, matching the composer and web-scrape surfaces that import them during
  normal RC5.2 operation.
- **Session schema durability** — session SQLite engines now set WAL,
  `busy_timeout`, synchronous PRAGMA, schema epoch guards, orphan PENDING-row
  recovery, and cross-DB hash spot-checks for interpretation runtime handoff.
- **Frontend auto-validation and session state** — validation triggers now use
  cache-aware `requestValidate`, failed validation no longer poisons version
  caches, active run progress blocks auto-validation, auth/session transitions
  clear stale validation state, and active-session null transitions reset
  execution state.
- **Hash routing and retired views** — the composer hash router moved from
  retired Spec/Runs tabs to graph/YAML/catalog modal actions, with stale
  bookmark redirects, shortcut rewiring, and explicit preservation notes for
  RunsView capabilities that moved into successor panels.

### Removed

- **Composer replacement-shape machinery** —
  `_runtime_preflight_failure_message`,
  `_enforce_replacement_non_prefix_invariant`, `_ReplacementBranch`,
  and `_INTERCEPTED_ASSISTANT_HISTORY_PREFIX` are deleted along with
  the 7 tests pinning the removed behaviour. The compose loop's
  augmentation shape (state-claim grounding correction + non-empty-state
  preflight) is now the sole codepath.
- **Retired composer IA surfaces** — the old Spec tab, Runs tab, SessionSidebar,
  inspector panel, inspector-page E2E object, and staging migration shims were
  removed after their live capabilities moved into the SideRail, modals, session
  switcher, run history, diagnostics, output panels, and validation banner.
- **Optional dependency extras drift** — the `web` and `rag` extras were retired
  once their packages became mandatory dependencies for the shipped composer/web
  surface.
- **Active-doc clutter** — superseded prompt files, generated review sidecars,
  completed handovers, point-in-time audits, archived release checklists, and
  one-off test-bug fixture scripts were removed from active paths or relocated
  into `docs-archive/2026-05-19-docs-cleanout/`.

### Operational

- **Sessions DB schema deployment requires recreation** — Phase 1A's
  new columns, tables, CHECKs, and partial unique indices are not
  applied via Alembic. Per `project_db_migration_policy`: stop the
  service, archive the old `sessions.db`, restart. The bootstrap
  creates the new schema on first start. Procedure documented in
  `docs/runbooks/staging-session-db-recreation.md`.
- **Phase 5 interpretation deployment requires two DBs to move together** —
  `interpretation_events_table`, `interpretation_review_disabled`, and the
  Landscape `calls_table.resolved_prompt_template_hash` handoff require the
  session DB and Landscape audit DB to be reset together on schema cutover.
  The staging recreation runbook documents the coupled reset.
- **Frontend-only deploys require static rebuild, not service restart** —
  `npm run build` refreshes `src/elspeth/web/frontend/dist/`; backend Python,
  dependency, environment, systemd, or Caddy changes still require
  `elspeth-web.service` restart.
- **Current PR check posture** — PR #39 now includes more than 770 committed
  branch commits over `main`, including the docs-cleanout merge. The PR body and
  release docs should be treated as the review map for the whole RC5.2 train,
  not for a single feature slice.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-11 (RC-5.1 — Composer Correctness, Validator Hardening, and Audit-Integrity Coverage)

RC-5.1 is a correctness and assurance follow-up to RC-5. The Web Composer's
authoring loop, validation surface, and run-evidence views all received targeted
hardening; a new `identity_node_advisory` validator detects identity passthroughs
that obscure observed-sink lineage; the `data_dir` config is now resolved to an
absolute path at validation time; pipeline recipes, source inspection, and a
forced-repair loop with proof diagnostics extend the composer authoring surface;
and the Landscape audit-integrity test surface gains direct coverage for four
ADR-019-family invariants that previously had zero unit tests. Frontend UX received
a Tier-1 panel-review pass covering accessibility, focus management, and operator
visibility.

### Added

#### RC5-UX Substrate, Composer, and Execution Evidence

- **Substrate-first README story** — README now presents ELSPETH as a
  high-assurance pipeline substrate with two authoring surfaces: hand-edited
  YAML for operators and the Web Composer for LLM-assisted authoring by
  non-pipeline-engineers.
- **Validator-mediated authoring framing** — the README now emphasizes that
  both surfaces target the same primitives, runtime assembly, graph-validation
  contracts, executor, Landscape audit trail, and run-accounting model instead
  of treating the web UI as a bolt-on workflow builder.
- **Expanded Web Composer surface** — authenticated sessions, versioned
  composition state, blob management, secret references, chat-first pipeline
  authoring, graph/spec/YAML inspection, validation, execution, cancellation,
  diagnostics, and output artifact review are now described as part of the
  authoring surface.
- **Audited composer tool loop** — the composer surface is now described as a
  tool-governed authoring loop: plugin discovery, state mutation, validation,
  YAML export, blob tools, secret-reference tools, and optional advisor hints
  all happen through explicit tool contracts.
- **Runtime-shaped validation and preflight** — composer previews, YAML export,
  `/validate`, and `/execute` are documented as using runtime assembly and graph
  validation contracts instead of a separate best-effort UI validator, while the
  compiled-artifact compiler boundary is stated as future direction.
- **Run evidence endpoints** — web execution now exposes Landscape-derived run
  accounting, diagnostics snapshots, discard summaries, and the full output
  artifact manifest/content surfaces for a run.
- **Cancellation visibility** — in-progress runs can carry a distinct
  cancellation-requested state while active work drains toward a terminal
  `cancelled` status.

#### Composer Reliability and Operator Visibility

- **Deterministic composer calls** — composer LLM requests use deterministic
  sampling where supported and record temperature/seed metadata in the LLM
  audit sidecar.
- **Prompt-cache-aware composer audit** — provider cache counters and
  Anthropic-style prompt-cache markers are captured without fabricating missing
  values.
- **Reasoning metadata capture** — composer LLM audit records can carry
  provider-reported reasoning token counts and reasoning artifacts when a
  provider exposes them; normal chat history still hides those internals.
- **Advisor escalation contract** — the optional advisor tool is gated behind
  explicit trigger categories so the composer can ask for frontier-model help
  only under mechanically validated conditions.
- **Hard-mode composer evaluation harness** — reusable shell tooling and
  scenario fan-out capture validation transport failures, composer regressions,
  and per-row output evidence for demo-readiness checks.
- **Advisor-conditional skill markers** — composer prompt assembly now strips
  both `<!-- ADVISOR-ONLY -->` and `<!-- ADVISOR-DISABLED -->` regions from the
  skill markdown depending on whether the advisor tool is enabled, so an
  advisor-disabled deployment can no longer leak `request_advisor_hint`
  guidance (anti-fabrication rule, fork+coalesce table row, Recipe #10
  escalation, §10b read-gate) to the composer LLM.

#### Plugin and Contract Surface

- **Plugin-declared semantic contracts** — plugins can now publish semantic
  facts, requirements, comparison outcomes, and composer assistance text; the
  composer, MCP server, HTTP validation, and `/execute` surfaces expose the
  same contract shape.
- **Statistical batch plugin family** — added runnable local examples for
  `batch_distribution_profile`, `batch_experiment_compare`,
  `batch_classifier_metrics`, `batch_paired_preference`,
  `batch_drift_compare`, `batch_outlier_annotator`,
  `batch_data_quality_report`, `batch_top_k`, `batch_threshold_summary`, and
  `batch_effect_size`.
- **Value-source and schema-contract guidance** — plugin catalogs and composer
  guidance now carry richer missing-dependency, schema vocabulary, and repair
  hints so an invalid pipeline points at the contract it violated.

#### Audit and Accounting Model

- **Two-axis terminal outcome model** — RC5-UX separates lifecycle outcome from
  terminal path/provenance so success, failure, routed, discarded, fallback, and
  structural bookkeeping cases no longer overload a single row outcome.
- **Run accounting split** — routed success/failure, token lifecycle counts,
  source-row counts, discard summaries, and closure integrity are reported as
  distinct units instead of being inferred from one `rows_routed` number.
- **Per-tool-call composer audit** — both the web composer and the standalone
  composer MCP server persist the tool-call decision trail that produced a
  pipeline.

#### CI, Policy, and Test Surface

- **Policy gates expanded** — branch work added or tightened gates for
  component types, guard symmetry, audit evidence nominal typing, tier-1
  decoration, contract manifests, composer exception channels, composer catch
  order, and tier-model allowlists.
- **Frontend Playwright baseline** — a real browser E2E harness now boots the
  FastAPI backend and Vite frontend, with an initial smoke proof and fixme
  specs for composer-correctness acceptance paths.

#### Validator and Pipeline Authoring (RC-5.1)

- **`identity_node_advisory` validator check** — `validate_pipeline` now detects
  identity passthrough nodes wired between transforms and observed sinks, where
  the passthrough silently degrades observed-sink lineage. The check is gated
  by an exemption matrix locked in by tests, surfaces as an actionable repair
  hint in the composer, and is enforced on the validation happy path.
- **Composer pipeline recipes** — `apply_pipeline_recipe` MCP tool plus two
  initial templates compose a multi-node pipeline from a single named recipe,
  with deep-frozen `RecipeSpec.slots`, `SlotSpec.default` validated against
  `slot_type` at construction, recipes that emit schema-valid `llm` and
  `type_coerce` options, and recipe `blob_id` placed at source top-level so
  `set_pipeline` can resolve it.
- **Source inspection MCP tool** — new `source_inspection` module and
  `inspect_source` MCP tool surface external-data shape and silent-failure modes
  as warnings, supporting "look before you wire" composer sessions; hostile-input
  coverage included for `inspect_blob_content`.
- **Forced-repair loop with proof diagnostics** — `preview_pipeline` runs a
  proof step that produces a `proof_diagnostics` array; the composer's
  forced-repair loop is wired to those diagnostics, fires on the resumed-session
  first turn, and plumbs `repair_turns_used` into `composition_states.composer_meta`.
  `compute_proof_diagnostics` verifies blob `content_hash` so a stale blob can
  no longer pass the proof gate. `_BLOCKING_DIAGNOSTIC_CODES` is now the
  structural source of truth for blocking diagnostics.
- **Audit-backend skill + recipe-first fork-coalesce shape** — composer skill
  pack adds an audit-backend skill and reorganises the fork-coalesce guidance
  to be recipe-first; canonical fork pattern aligned to the
  `validate_boolean_routes` contract; mandatory advisor escalation gate for
  Recipe #10 (fork+coalesce) shapes.
- **Convergence-suite test scenarios** — new evaluation scenarios cover
  end-to-end convergence (URL-text smoke, mocked-LLM integration, end-to-end
  forced-repair through the real `_compose_loop`, end-to-end
  `apply_pipeline_recipe` through the proof step) plus a pure scoring function;
  fork-and-coalesce regression scenario locks in skill commit `a2d9706b`.
- **Composer authoring affordances** — `Use in pipeline` action in the plugin
  catalog prefills the chat input; chat code blocks gain syntax highlighting
  and a copy-to-clipboard control; `secret_ref` advertises an inline form for
  new-node credentials; resize-handle keyboard arrows align with value
  direction with a static affordance and touch-friendly hit zone.
- **`<OPERATOR_REQUIRED>` sentinels for identity-bearing fields** — the
  composer skill replaces literal example values for
  `web_scrape.http.abuse_contact` and `scraping_reason` with angle-bracket
  sentinels and an explicit resolution order (operator-supplied →
  deployment-identity → ask the operator before `set_pipeline`). The
  angle-bracket form is intentional: a placeholder validator (tracked
  separately) can mechanically reject any YAML that still carries a
  sentinel, providing a structural safety net for the prompt-level rule.
- **Hard rule against silent operator-input rewrites** — composer skill now
  forbids silent normalisations of operator-supplied strings (e.g. prepending
  `https://` to a bare hostname, lowercasing, trailing-slash strip). Any
  rewrite must either be confirmed by the operator or routed through a
  recorded normalisation step (`value_transform` etc.) so it appears in the
  YAML and the build summary.
- **Implicit-decision disclosure ("Decisions I made on your behalf")** — new
  Build Summary Discipline subsection requires the composer to enumerate
  operator-invisible authoring decisions (identity headers, model/provider/
  temperature, output shape and routing, format choices, allowlist defaults,
  surviving operator-input rewrites) with explicit provenance markers
  (`default` / `picked` / `deployment-identity` / `operator-supplied`).

#### Run Evidence and Operator Visibility (RC-5.1)

- **Run outputs panel** — frontend `RunOutputsPanel` exposes the full
  audit-evidence manifest for a run, with downloadable artifacts gated by a
  per-artifact `downloadable` flag; backed by a new `/artifacts/preview`
  execution endpoint.
- **Cancellation-requested badge** — runs whose cancellation has been requested
  but not yet drained now carry a distinct badge style, separate from the
  terminal `cancelled` state.
- **GraphView viewport preservation** — composer GraphView preserves the
  operator's pan/zoom across topology changes, so iterative edits no longer
  reset the view to a default `fitView`.
- **`data_dir` resolved to absolute path** — `WebSettings` now resolves
  `data_dir` to an absolute path at validation time, eliminating a class of
  ambiguity where relative paths were interpreted against different working
  directories at validate vs. run time.
- **Composer source-inspection silent-failure surfacing** — Tier-3 source
  inspection surfaces silent-failure modes (e.g. all-rows quarantined) as
  warnings rather than treating success-with-zero-results as a quiet pass.
- **Failure-sample aggregation in run-level errors** — new
  `web/execution/failure_samples` module aggregates the top distinct
  `transform_errors` rows so a failed run's top-level error message carries
  actionable detail rather than a single bubble-up exception string.

#### Audit Integrity Test Coverage (RC-5.1)

- **ADR-019 deferred-invariant sweep** — direct unit coverage for the
  `sweep_deferred_invariants_or_crash` run-end invariant enforcer (was
  previously zero unit tests).
- **DataFlowRepository `_validate_token_row_ownership`** — direct coverage for
  the cross-row lineage corruption guard (previously never directly tested).
- **`link_validation_error_to_row` branches** — direct coverage for quarantine
  lineage exactness across all branches.
- **`_REQUIRED_COMPOSITE_FOREIGN_KEYS`** — exhaustive coverage for all 12
  composite foreign-key entries (previously 11 of 12 untested).
- **SSRF blocked-IP coverage** — closes residual blocklist coverage including
  the `::ffff:0:0/96` IPv4-mapped-IPv6 range and seven other previously
  untested boundary cases in `web_scrape`.

#### Contracts and Lifecycle (RC-5.1)

- **Symmetric `_on_start_called` / `_on_complete_called` lifecycle flags** —
  runtime-config protocols now expose paired start/complete lifecycle flags so
  asymmetric implementations (start without complete, or complete without
  start) become structurally detectable.
- **Autouse catalog fixture + derived `RUNTIME_CONFIGS`** — contract tests now
  derive the runtime-config inventory from runtime introspection rather than
  a hand-maintained list, eliminating drift between the inventory and the
  actually-registered configs.

### Changed

- **README front door refreshed for RC-5** — the README now leads with the
  high-assurance substrate, the gap ELSPETH closes, the two authoring audiences,
  architecture at a glance, parallel YAML/Web Composer start paths, capability
  map, audit/assurance model, and shipped-vs-direction compiler status.
- **Web quickstart port corrected** — the README quickstart now uses the
  `elspeth web` default port `8451`.
- **Batch-specific LLM transforms retired from the public story** —
  `azure_batch_llm` and `openrouter_batch_llm` are no longer advertised. Use
  the regular `llm` transform with provider pooling/multi-query for LLM
  throughput and the statistical batch transforms for audit-attributable local
  aggregation.
- **Default `on_validation_failure` is now `discard`** — the default
  per-source validation-failure behaviour changed to `discard` with documented
  quarantine semantics, replacing the prior implicit fall-through.
- **Unknown-plugin composer error is now actionable** —
  `_prevalidate_plugin_options` surfaces an unknown plugin id as a structured,
  actionable rejection instead of a silent fail-open.
- **Composer rejected-mutation entries lead `validation.errors`** — when a
  composer mutation is rejected, the rejection entry is now the first item in
  `validation.errors`, so downstream UI surfaces and skill prose treat it as
  the primary diagnostic.
- **Augment-shape preflight failures preserve model prose** — when an
  augment-shape preflight fails, the composer now retains the model's original
  prose explanation instead of replacing it with a generic failure summary.
- **`apply_pipeline_recipe` surfaces destructive replacement** — applying a
  recipe over an existing pipeline now explicitly reports the replacement as
  destructive in the composer audit trail.

### Fixed

- **Wire-visible identity fabrication (Tier-1 audit-integrity defect)** — the
  composer skill previously carried `compliance@example.com` and a generic
  scraping reason as the canonical worked example for the
  `web_scrape.http.abuse_contact` / `scraping_reason` fields, and the LLM was
  copying those literals into generated YAML verbatim. A reproduced eval
  session shipped a fabricated abuse-contact email as an HTTP header to three
  external `.gov.au` sites — a confident wrong answer to a third party we have
  no relationship with. Closed by the `<OPERATOR_REQUIRED>` sentinel rewrite,
  the silent-rewrite hard rule, and the implicit-decision disclosure block
  (see *Validator and Pipeline Authoring (RC-5.1)*).
- **Composer skill correctness** — multi-commit sweep closing skill-text
  fabrication and silent-shape-downgrade loopholes, widening the grounding
  detector and adding `confirm`/`confirmed` to the grounding verb list, scoping
  state-claim grounding correction (Path 3), forbidding identity nodes between
  transforms and observed sinks, and narrowing the `ComposerResult` pairing
  invariant.
- **Composer accessibility (Tier-1 panel review)** — `aria-controls` IDREF
  remains resolvable when a run is collapsed; `aria-expanded` added to the
  `RunsView` Inspect button (now using the shared `.btn` class); health-check
  banners downgraded to `role=status`; nested `aria-live` removed from
  `ComposingIndicator`; `aria-live` scoped to the validation banner instead of
  the tab panel; light-theme `--color-status-empty` override added; validation
  indicator decoupled from the warning colour.
- **Composer SecretsPanel form recovery** — the form now recovers cleanly when
  `createSecret` fails, instead of leaving the panel in a wedged state.
- **Composer audit-shape symmetry** — `augment` and `replace` audit shapes now
  use symmetric producer-side invariants.

## [0.5.0] (RC-5 — Web UX Composer + Systematic Hardening)

Full web application platform for chat-first pipeline composition, three-provider authentication, session management with versioning, blob storage, secret management, background pipeline execution with WebSocket progress, and a React frontend themed to DTA/AGDS guidelines. Also: sink failsink pattern for per-row write failure routing, pipeline composer MCP server, DAG schema propagation (`output_schema_config` as single source of truth), declaration-trust / compiler-boundary hardening for pre-data runtime guarantees, frontend UX refresh (A1-A7), composer agent tooling (B1-B5) and skill pack update (C1-D4), guard symmetry CI scanner, `TokenRef` type, exception hygiene with `TIER_1_ERRORS`, a 200+ bug closure campaign across all subsystems, and a comprehensive test hygiene sweep removing ~500 low-value tests while adding ~200 gap-filling tests.

### Added

#### Declaration-Trust / Compiler-Boundary Hardening

- **Declaration-trust framework** — generalized ELSPETH's config-to-execution contract into a first-class declaration-trust system. Declarations trusted during graph construction and web validation — including pass-through behavior, declared input/output fields, schema mode, source guaranteed fields, sink required fields, and empty-emission governance — are now explicit, validated at compile time where possible, enforced by CI manifest/scanner guardrails, recorded in the run header via the runtime VAL manifest, and re-verified at runtime with audit-complete violation reporting. This moves the web UX closer to a true compiler front-end: a configuration that validates is one that satisfies every pre-data runtime guarantee ELSPETH can assess before Tier 3 data arrives.

#### Web UX Composer Platform

- **`elspeth web` CLI command** — FastAPI app factory with `[webui]` extra, `WebSettings` config model, and default port 8451. Serves the React SPA from `src/elspeth/web/frontend/dist/`.
- **React frontend bundle** — Vite-built SPA with `/api` and `/ws` proxying for development.
- **DTA/AGDS theming** — deep teal, green accent, and GOLD semantic colours matching Australian Government Design System guidelines.
- **Frontend UX** — logout UI, session creation guards, archive sessions, confirm destructive actions, version loading, bumped font sizes.
- **Accessibility** — skip-to-content links, reduced motion support, touch target sizing.

#### Authentication Subsystem

- **`AuthProvider` protocol** — pluggable identity model with `AuthenticationError` base exception.
- **`LocalAuthProvider`** — bcrypt password hashing with JWT token issuance.
- **`OIDCAuthProvider`** — OpenID Connect with JWKS discovery and key caching.
- **`EntraAuthProvider`** — Microsoft Entra ID with tenant validation and group claims.
- **`get_current_user` middleware** — FastAPI dependency for route-level authentication.
- **Auth routes** — login, token refresh, user profile, configuration endpoints.
- **Registration endpoint** — configurable mode (`open`, `email_verified`, `closed`).
- **python-jose → PyJWT migration** — replaced unmaintained library across all auth code.

#### Plugin Catalog

- **`CatalogService` protocol and implementation** — plugin discovery service with REST API routes wired into the app factory.

#### Session Management

- **SQLAlchemy Core table definitions** — session database schema with migrations.
- **`SessionServiceProtocol`** and `SessionServiceImpl` — CRUD, versioning, run enforcement, with `RunAlreadyActiveError`.

- **Fork-from-message** — create new session versions branching from specific conversation messages, with text source plugin.
- **TOCTOU race elimination** — DB-level constraints replacing application-level checks (batch 6).
- **Thread pool executor** — all DB calls moved off the async event loop (batch 5).
- **Orphan cleanup** — wired into FastAPI lifespan, UUID path parameters.

#### Blob Storage Manager

- **Phase 1** — data model, service foundation, migration.
- **Phase 2** — REST API routes and app wiring.
- **Phases 3–6** — frontend integration, composer tools, execution integration, schema inference.
- **Upload dedup, quota enforcement, and file cleanup.**

#### Secret Reference System

- **`SecretResolution` audit extension** — accepts `"env"` and `"user"` sources for web-originated secrets.
- **`resolve_secret_refs()` tree-walk** — recursive config replacement of `$secret{name}` references.
- **`ServerSecretStore`** and `WebSecretService` — chained resolution with allowlist enforcement, env-var boundary, fingerprint audit.
- **REST API, composer tools, execution integration, frontend wiring.**
- **Security hardening** — audit trail, fingerprints, leakage prevention, input validation.

#### Pipeline Execution Layer

- **Background pipeline runs** — `ExecutionServiceImpl` with WebSocket progress streaming and dry-run validation.
- **Cancel-vs-execute race closure** — atomic state transition preventing concurrent execution attempts.
- **Late WebSocket client seeding** — clients connecting after run start receive current state.

#### Pipeline Composer (LLM Tool-Use)

- **Frozen data models** — `SourceSpec`, `NodeSpec`, `EdgeSpec`, `OutputSpec`, `PipelineMetadata` with deep immutability.
- **Composition tools and YAML generator** — Sub-4B + 4C tool implementations.
- **`ComposerService` protocol** — LLM tool-use loop with prompts and message management (Sub-4D).
- **Wired to session routes** — composer integrated into session API.
- **Sub-4x hardening** — dual-counter loop guard, discovery cache, partial state recovery, rate limiting, tool registry.
- **Enhanced Stage 1 validation** — warnings, suggestions, and status tint.

#### Pipeline Inspector

- **`validate_sink_failsink_destinations()`** — construction-time validation of failsink routing.
- **`SinkExecutor.write()` routing** — failsink dispatch on per-row write failure.
- **Hypothesis property tests** — partition-completeness and exactly-once routing invariants.

#### DAG Schema Propagation

- **`output_schema_config` as single source of truth** — populated for all node types (source, transform, gate, aggregation, coalesce) at construction time. `_assign_schema` refactored to only set `output_schema_config`, dropping the parallel dict write.

#### Frontend UX Refresh (A1-A7)

- **A1: Categorized file folders in blob manager** — files organized by category.
- **A2: Markdown and Mermaid rendering in chat** — rich content display with DOMPurify sanitization.

#### TokenRef Type

- **`TokenRef`** — bundled `token_id + run_id` frozen dataclass in `contracts/`. Replaces loose 2-tuple passing.
- **`AuditIntegrityError` loader guards** — Landscape read sites crash on corruption.
- **`coalesce_tokens` on TokenRef** — Landscape API accepts `TokenRef` directly.
- **`_validate_token_run_ownership` refactored** — accepts `TokenRef` instead of separate args.

#### Exception Hygiene

- **`TIER_1_ERRORS` constant** — canonical tuple of exception types for Tier 1 catch sites, applied across all layers.

#### Server Configuration

- **Default port 8451** — server config design with skill restoration.

- **`_raise_if_invalid` extraction** — eliminates 3x error formatting duplication in manager.
- **`_make_span` extraction** — eliminates 7x no-op guard duplication in spans.

- **`archive/` directory** — all content preserved in git history.

### Tests

## [0.4.1] (RC-4.1 — RAG Ingestion Pipeline)

Complete RAG ingestion story: ChromaSink for vector store population, pipeline `depends_on` for run sequencing, commencement gates for pre-flight go/no-go checks, and readiness contracts on retrieval providers. First pipeline-level orchestration primitives. Designed as a generic multi-stage pipeline pattern — RAG is the first consumer, but any plugin needing pre-populated external state can use the same mechanisms.

### Added

#### ChromaSink Plugin

- **ChromaSink** — new sink plugin writing pipeline rows into ChromaDB collections. Three `on_duplicate` modes: `overwrite` (upsert), `skip` (pre-filter existing IDs), `error` (pre-check and reject). Canonical content hash computed before write for audit integrity.
- **`FieldMappingConfig`** — explicit field mapping from row fields to ChromaDB concepts (`document_field`, `id_field`, `metadata_fields`). No convention-based defaults — operator declares exactly what goes where.
- **`DuplicateDocumentError`** — structured exception with `collection` and `duplicate_ids` (stored as immutable tuple) for `on_duplicate: error` mode.
- **ChromaDB metadata type validation** — metadata field values are validated as `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, or `None` at write time, before sending to ChromaDB. Invalid types (e.g. `dict`, `datetime`) crash with a `TypeError` naming the exact field, type, row index, and document ID.

#### Pipeline `depends_on` Mechanism

- **`depends_on` top-level config key** — declare pipelines that must run before the main pipeline starts. Each dependency is a fully independent pipeline run with its own `run_id`, Landscape records, and checkpoint stream.
- **`bootstrap_and_run()`** — reusable headless pipeline entry point in `cli_helpers.py` (L3). Handles secret resolution, passphrase handling, and directory creation. Injected into the dependency resolver via `PipelineRunner` protocol.
- **Circular dependency detection** — DFS cycle detector on canonicalized paths (`Path.resolve()`), with 3-level depth limit for nested dependencies.
- **Sequential execution** — dependencies run in declared order. `KeyboardInterrupt` propagates as-is (not wrapped in `DependencyFailedError`).
- **`DependencyRunResult`** — frozen dataclass with `run_id`, `settings_hash`, `duration_ms`, `indexed_at` for audit correlation.
- **Resume behaviour** — `elspeth resume` does NOT re-run dependencies. Fresh run required if dependencies need re-running.

#### Commencement Gates

- **`commencement_gates` top-level config key** — go/no-go conditions evaluated after dependencies complete, before the main pipeline starts.
- **`ExpressionParser` `allowed_names` extension** — gate expressions use the existing AST-whitelist parser with configurable namespace names (`collections`, `dependency_runs`, `env`). No `eval()`.
- **Pre-flight context** — assembled from dependency results, collection probes, and environment variables. Deep-frozen before gate evaluation (TOCTOU-safe). `env` excluded from Landscape audit snapshots to prevent secret leakage.
- **`collection_probes` explicit config** — operators declare which collections to probe. Probes assembled from explicit config, not auto-scanned from plugin configs.
- **`CommencementGateResult`** — frozen dataclass with `context_snapshot` deep-frozen via `freeze_fields()`.

#### Readiness Contract

- **`check_readiness()` on `RetrievalProvider` protocol** — returns `CollectionReadinessResult` (L0). Single-attempt, no retry. Called during `on_start()` after provider construction.
- **`ChromaSearchProvider.check_readiness()`** — collection count check with narrowed exception handling (connectivity errors only, not broad `except Exception`).
- **`AzureSearchProvider.check_readiness()`** — raw `httpx` count endpoint probe (not `AuditedHTTPClient`, which requires row-scoped `state_id`/`token_id` unavailable during `on_start()`).
- **RAG transform readiness guard** — `on_start()` checks both `reachable` and `count`. Raises `RetrievalNotReadyError` with `collection` and `reason` fields, with distinct messages for "empty" vs "unreachable".

#### Shared Infrastructure

- **`CollectionReadinessResult`** — unified frozen dataclass in L0 (`contracts/probes.py`) for all collection readiness checks. Used by probes, providers, and transforms.
- **`CollectionProbe` protocol** — L0 protocol for collection readiness probes, injectable into L2 engine without layer violations.
- **`ChromaConnectionConfig`** — shared Pydantic model for ChromaDB connection fields. Composed by `ChromaSinkConfig`, `ChromaSearchProviderConfig`, and `CollectionProbeConfig`. Collection name validated (min 3 chars, regex pattern).
- **`RetrievalNotReadyError`** — structured exception with keyword-only `collection` and `reason` fields.
- **`DependencyFailedError`** — structured exception with `dependency_name`, `run_id`, `reason`.
- **`CommencementGateFailedError`** — structured exception with deep-frozen `context_snapshot`.

#### Landscape Audit Trail

- **`preflight_results` table** — new Landscape table recording dependency runs and gate evaluations per pipeline run. `result_type` discriminator with `CheckConstraint`. Canonical JSON serialization via `deep_thaw()` + `canonical_json()`.
- **Readiness check outcomes recorded** — transform readiness results persisted alongside dependency and gate results.
- **Deferred recording pattern** — pre-flight results computed in `bootstrap_and_run()`, carried through `orchestrator.run()` as `PreflightResult`, recorded after `begin_run()`. Same pattern as `secret_resolutions`.
- **Dependency run correlation** — query run metadata links to indexing run via `run_id`, `settings_hash`, `indexed_at`. Auditor can trace: question → retrieved chunks → source documents → indexing decision → corpus state.

#### End-to-End Example

- **`examples/chroma_rag_indexed/`** — complete example: indexing pipeline (CSV → ChromaSink) + query pipeline (`depends_on` + commencement gate + RAG retrieval). Replaces the standalone `seed_collection.py` script with an audited pipeline.
- **CLI preflight wiring** — `elspeth run` now executes `depends_on` and commencement gates when configured.

### Fixed

#### Exception Hygiene Completion

- **3 overly-broad `except Exception` catches narrowed** to specific exception types in azure_batch, completing the exception narrowing sweep.
- **`batch_batch_timeout` double-prefix bug** — corrected in azure_batch per-row failure reason field. The prefix was applied twice, producing malformed reason strings.
- **Test asserting the bug** — corrected test that was asserting the buggy double-prefix behaviour rather than the correct single-prefix.
- **`TransformErrorCategory` and `TransformActionCategory` Literal gaps closed** — added missing category values that were valid at runtime but not in the type definitions.
- **HMAC-equivalent key pair filtering** — fingerprint property test now correctly filters HMAC-equivalent key pairs to avoid false failures.

#### Tier 1 Audit Integrity Hardening

- **`require_int()` utility** — Tier 1 int-field validator rejecting `bool` (Python's `isinstance(True, int)` footgun) and enforcing `min_value` bounds. Applied to 19 int fields across 13 audit dataclasses, plus `node_state_context`, `token_usage`, `batch_checkpoint`, `BufferEntry`, and `ResumePoint`.
- **TypedDict export records** — 15 typed shapes replacing `dict[str, Any]` in `LandscapeExporter._iter_records()`. `record_type` narrowed to `Literal` per record for mypy discriminated union support.
- **`CoalescePolicy` and `MergeStrategy` StrEnums** — replace bare strings in `CoalesceMetadata` and all call sites. Serialization-safe via `StrEnum`.
- **`Mapping[str, object]` write-path narrowing** — Tier 1 write paths in recorder and repositories narrowed from `dict[str, Any]` to `Mapping[str, object]` for tighter type safety.
- **`allow_nan=False`** — added to 6 `json.dumps()` calls in audit-path code, preventing NaN/Infinity from silently entering the Landscape.

### Changed

- **`ExpressionParser`** — now supports configurable `allowed_names` parameter (default `["row"]` for existing callers). Gate expressions use `["collections", "dependency_runs", "env"]`.
- **`ChromaSearchProviderConfig`** — refactored to compose `ChromaConnectionConfig` for shared validation. `to_connection_config()` method added.
- **`ElspethSettings`** — gains optional `depends_on`, `commencement_gates`, `collection_probes` fields.

## [0.4.0] (RC-4.0 — Plugins, Contracts, and Correctness)

Major feature release: Dataverse and RAG retrieval plugins, output schema contract enforcement, audit provenance boundary, freeze/serialize coherence, errorworks migration, and a 64-bug systematic sweep. Completes the RC-3.4 hardening sprint and delivers the first external-system plugin integrations. Also includes the agentic code threat model discussion paper (v0.1–v0.4) with MkDocs wiki and LaTeX build pipeline.

### Added

#### Dataverse Source and Sink Plugins

- **`DataverseSource`** — Microsoft Dataverse integration via OData v4 REST API. Supports structured OData queries and FetchXML with schema contracts. Pagination, SSRF validation, and rate limiting via the new `DataverseClient`.
- **`DataverseSink`** — upsert-only writes via PATCH with alternate key, idempotent for retries. Pre-processes all rows before HTTP calls.
- **`DataverseClient`** — pure protocol client handling authentication, pagination, SSRF validation, and rate limiting for the OData v4 API.
- **Shared utility extraction** — fingerprinting (`fingerprinting.py`) and strict JSON parsing (`json_utils.py`) extracted from `AuditedHTTPClient` into shared modules. 288 new tests.

#### RAG Retrieval Transform

- **`RAGRetrievalTransform`** — full retrieval-augmented generation transform with lifecycle management, process flow, and telemetry. Declared output schema config for downstream contract enforcement.
- **`RetrievalProvider` protocol** — L0 protocol with `RetrievalChunk` result type. Two implementations: `ChromaSearchProvider` (ephemeral/persistent/client modes, distance normalization) and `AzureSearchProvider` (score normalization, Tier 3 validation).
- **Query construction** — three modes: `field` (direct row field), `template` (string interpolation), `regex` (pattern extraction from row data).
- **Context formatting** — `numbered`, `separated`, and `raw` modes for assembling retrieved chunks into LLM context.
- **Shared template infrastructure** — extracted from LLM plugin for reuse by RAG query construction.
- **`PluginRetryableError`** — new base exception class. `LLMClientError` and `WebScrapeError` re-parented under it. Processor retry dispatch updated. New retrieval error categories added to `TransformErrorCategory`.
- **Example pipelines** — `examples/chroma_rag/` (standalone RAG) and `examples/chroma_rag_qa/` (RAG + LLM Q&A).

#### Output Schema Contract Enforcement

- **`_output_schema_config`** — new class attribute on `BaseTransform` with `_build_output_schema_config` helper. All field-adding transforms now declare their guaranteed output fields.
- **`FrameworkBugError` guard** — DAG builder crashes if a transform declares output fields but is missing `_output_schema_config`, preventing silent schema drift.
- **Integration tests** — full enforcement test and edge validation tests for output schema contracts.

#### Audit Provenance Boundary Enforcement

- **LLM audit metadata migration** — both batch and multi-query transforms now store audit fields in `success_reason` instead of polluting row data. Per-query provenance dicts collected and merged into `success_reason["metadata"]`.
- **`Call` return from `get_ssrf_safe()`** — `AuditedHTTPClient` now surfaces the `Call` object for audit correlation.
- **`payload_store` removed from `PluginContext`** — plugins access blob storage through `recorder.store_payload()` only, enforcing the provenance boundary.

#### Freeze/Serialize Coherence

- **Frozen container support in `contracts/hashing.py`** — canonical JSON serialization now handles `MappingProxyType`, `tuple`, and `frozenset` natively, resolving impedance mismatch between `deep_freeze` and hashing at L0.
- **Property tests** — hash equivalence (frozen == unfrozen), cross-module parity tests, frozen round-trip contract tests.
- **5 live bugs patched** — `MappingProxyType` NaN bypass, enum export, SSRF metadata, shallow thaw.
- **Thaw-refreeze elimination** — `plugin_context.record_call` no longer round-trips through thaw/refreeze. `ArtifactDescriptor` uses `deep_freeze` instead of shallow `MappingProxyType` wrap.

#### CI Enforcement

- **`enforce_freeze_guards.py`** — AST-based CI scanner detecting forbidden freeze patterns in `__post_init__`: bare `MappingProxyType` wraps (FG1) and `isinstance` type guards to skip freezing (FG2). Per-file allowlists with `max_hits`.
- **`enforce_mutable_annotations.py`** — CI linter detecting `list[]`/`dict[]`/`set[]` annotations on frozen dataclass fields. Allowlist for justified exceptions. *(Not yet merged — tracked for future implementation.)*
- **`freeze_fields()` promoted** to `contracts/freeze.py` as the canonical freeze utility. All freeze guards standardised.

#### web_scrape SSRF Allowlist

- **`allowed_hosts` configuration** — three-tier IP validation: `ALWAYS_BLOCKED_RANGES` (link-local, broadcast, multicast) → user allowlist (CIDR) → standard blocked ranges. Accepts `"public_only"` (default), `"allow_private"`, or explicit CIDR list. Threaded through redirect chain. 62 new tests.
- **Dual URL audit output** — both hostname and resolved IP URLs surfaced for audit comparison.

### Changed

- **`PipelineConfig` annotations** — `list`/`dict` fields changed to `Sequence`/`Mapping` to match frozen runtime types.
- **Field normalization mandatory** — removed `normalize_fields` toggle from `CSVSource`, `AzureBlobSource`, and `DataverseSource`. Header normalization always applied at the source boundary. Dunder name regression test added.
- **errorworks migration** — ChaosLLM, ChaosWeb, and ChaosEngine moved to external `errorworks` PyPI package (≥0.1.1). In-tree `chaosengine/`, `chaosllm/`, `chaosweb/`, `chaosllm_mcp/` directories deleted. Stale CLI subcommands removed.
- **Fabricated audit records removed** — `CallType.HTTP` records from `batch_replicate` validation and fabricated `variables_hash` sentinel from batch audit metadata.
- **Logger hygiene** — redundant logs removed, LLM `success_reason` audit metadata enriched.

### Fixed

- **RAG subsystem** (3 bugs) — crash detection, resource cleanup, truncation budget.
- **ChromaDB distance type guard** (2 bugs) — crash on corrupt index instead of silent skip. Improved crash messages with collection name, doc ID, and remediation.

#### Additional Fixes

- **Plugin exception catch hygiene** (5 bugs) — pooling, search, sink, processor.
- **Exception type and chain hygiene** (5 bugs) — across contracts/engine/plugins.
- **Tier 1 checkpoint deserialization** — crash on corruption, don't coerce.
- **`AuditIntegrityError` misattribution** — prevented by outer exception handlers via dedicated error guard.
- **Unwrapped `record_call` SUCCESS paths** — all wrapped in `AuditIntegrityError`.
- **CLAUDE.md compliance** — defensive patterns, immutability, structlog, test types.

#### Mutation Testing

- **Checkpoint restore and WHERE clause exactness** — 71 new tests killing mutation survivors across 3 landscape repositories.

## [0.3.4] (RC-3.4 — Systematic Hardening)

Systematic hardening sprint driven by 191-bug triage, mutation testing, and code quality sweep. Focus: audit integrity, deep immutability, construction-time validation, exception hygiene, and elimination of defensive anti-patterns. No new features — pure correctness and reliability work.

### Fixed

#### Audit Integrity & Tier 1 Hardening

- **PayloadNotFoundError domain exception** — `PayloadStore` protocol, `FilesystemPayloadStore`, and `MockPayloadStore` now raise `PayloadNotFoundError` instead of generic `KeyError`, preventing accidental catch by `except KeyError:` dict-lookup handlers. All five caller sites updated. PURGED paths now emit debug logs with `content_hash` for operational visibility.
- **PayloadIntegrityError → AuditIntegrityError** — `get_call_response_data` now catches `PayloadIntegrityError` and translates to `AuditIntegrityError` with run/call context, instead of letting raw integrity errors escape the landscape layer.
- **AuditIntegrityError for Tier 1 corruption** — Lineage queries, edge lookups, and purge grade updates now raise `AuditIntegrityError` instead of generic `ValueError` when encountering corrupt audit data.
- **Silent default=str fallback removed** — Journal serialization no longer silently coerces unserializable types via `default=str`. Non-serializable data now crashes immediately, exposing the upstream bug.
- **BatchCheckpointState tuple restoration** — `from_dict()` now restores tuple types after JSON round-trip instead of leaving them as lists, preserving Tier 1 checkpoint invariants.
- **Null-content LLM responses recorded** — Null-content responses are now recorded in the audit trail before raising, closing an audit gap where failed LLM calls left no trace.
- **Exception type hygiene** — `ValueError` replaced with `AuditIntegrityError` or `OrchestrationInvariantError` at 12 sites where the generic type misrepresented the failure category.
- **Tier 1 invariants in graph.py** — DAG graph now crashes on invalid source count, missing route labels, and defensive `.get()` patterns that masked corruption.
- **Programming-error guards in exporters** — Exporters and journal now raise `AuditIntegrityError` or `FrameworkBugError` instead of silently continuing on corrupt state.
- **Dead `ExecutionError.from_dict()` deleted** — Removed dead deserialization method; `TokenUsage.from_dict()` now rejects bool values that would silently coerce to int.

#### Deep Immutability & Frozen Dataclass Hardening

- **Central freeze/thaw utilities** — New `deep_freeze()` and `deep_thaw()` functions standardize immutability across all frozen dataclasses, replacing ad-hoc `deepcopy` calls.
- **deep_freeze recursion** — Now recurses into tuples, frozensets, and `MappingProxyType` contents, closing gaps where nested mutable containers survived freezing.
- **Mutable dict fields frozen** — All frozen checkpoint dataclasses now freeze mutable dict fields at construction, preventing post-construction mutation of Tier 1 data.
- **Category A mutable-frozen bugs** — Enforced deep immutability on 5 frozen dataclasses where mutable fields were exposed.
- **Category B mutable-frozen bugs** — Froze 5 additional DTOs with mutable internal state.
- **`slots=True` on all frozen dataclasses** — Added `slots=True` to `ResumeCheck`, `ResumePoint`, `RowDataResult`, `_GateEntry`, and all remaining frozen dataclasses that lacked it.
- **Contracts layer hardened** — Frozen sets, `deep_freeze` over `deepcopy`, `AuditIntegrityError` for checkpoint corruption.
- **HTTP DTO headers copied before freezing** — Prevents shared mutable header dicts from being modified after DTO construction.
- **Frozen constants and LineageResult** — Immutability hardened across engine constants and lineage query results.
- **Frozen/shared data structure enforcement** — Cleared `cluster:mutable-frozen` bug cluster.

#### Construction-Time Validation (`__post_init__`)

- **12 frozen dataclass types validated** — Added `__post_init__` validation enforcing invariants at construction time across contracts and engine types.
- **Remaining `cluster:missing-post-init` types** — Completed validation coverage for all frozen dataclasses that lacked construction-time checks.
- **NaN bypass and generator truthiness** — Fixed `__post_init__` validators that failed to detect NaN values and generators that evaluated truthy regardless of content.
- **Coalesce checkpoint DTO validation** — `CoalesceTokenCheckpoint` and `CoalescePendingCheckpoint` now enforce non-empty identifiers, non-negative timing, dict types, and disjoint branch keys.
- **Config-time validation** — Added validation for free-string fields, encoding, delimiters, and cross-field invariants at settings load time, clearing `cluster:config-validation`.

#### Exception Handling Hygiene

- **Exception chains preserved** — Replaced `from None` with `from exc` across 16 files, preserving diagnostic context in exception chains.
- **5 broken exception chains repaired** — Fixed `raise X from None` patterns in engine, plugins, and CLI that destroyed root-cause information.
- **22 broad `except Exception` catches narrowed** — Replaced overly broad catches with specific exception types, clearing `cluster:broad-except`.
- **Missing programming-error re-raises** — Added `FrameworkBugError`/`AuditIntegrityError` re-raise guards to telemetry `except` blocks that swallowed system errors.
- **Generic exceptions replaced** — Domain-specific error types (`AuditIntegrityError`, `GraphValidationError`, `OrchestrationInvariantError`) replace generic `ValueError`/`RuntimeError`, clearing `cluster:wrong-exception-type`.
- **Silent skips → explicit crashes** — 6 audit-gap bugs where code silently returned on invalid state now crash with invariant violation messages.

#### Defensive Pattern Removal

- **`hasattr()` banned unconditionally** — All 3 occurrences replaced with type-safe alternatives. `hasattr` is no longer allowlistable in the tier model enforcer.
- **Defensive `.get()` → required-fields validation** — `AggregationNodeCheckpoint.from_dict()` and other Tier 1 deserializers now validate required fields explicitly instead of using `.get()` with defaults.
- **Defensive access patterns removed** — Two passes across typed and Tier 1 data, replacing `.get(key, default)` with direct access on data we own.
- **CUSTOM header mode fail-closed** — Sink header mode `CUSTOM` now raises on unmapped fields instead of silently falling back to normalized names.

#### Data Fabrication Elimination

- **10 `cluster:fabrication` bugs fixed** — Replaced fabricated defaults (`None` → `0`, missing → empty string) with explicit validation or propagation of absence.
- **LLM batch, DB sink, and coalesce fabrication** — Eliminated silent default injection in three additional paths where missing data was replaced with invented values.

#### Audit-Gap Bug Fixes

- **4 TOCTOU races, silent blank rows, checkpoint invariant** — Fixed race conditions in concurrent audit writes and checkpoint state transitions.
- **3 credential leak, buffer corruption, record ordering** — Closed credential exposure in error messages, buffer mutation after read, and out-of-order audit record insertion.
- **2 rowcount validation, dict mutation** — Added rowcount assertions for fork/coalesce/expand writes; fixed in-place dict mutation in sequential multi-query.
- **4 row_data serialization, replayer Tier 1 reads** — Protected row_data from mutation during serialization; hardened replayer reads to crash on corruption.
- **Audit-gap silent failures recorded** — Error file download, malformed JSONL, and batch quarantine now record failures instead of silently dropping them.

#### Plugin & Engine Fixes

- **`_prepare_call_payloads` extracted** — Deduplicates payload preparation between `record_call` and `record_operation_call`.
- **`_make_checkpoint_after_sink_factory` extracted** — Deduplicates checkpoint-after-sink closure across orchestrator paths.
- **`dataclass_to_dict` tuple handling** — Now handles tuples correctly; fixed `has_retries` off-by-one comparison.
- **Azure client close-before-null** — `CallDataResult` discriminated type replaces ambiguous `None` return from Azure client operations.
- **Missing fingerprint key crashes** — Auth header fingerprinting now crashes on missing key instead of silently skipping; non-finite row indices recorded in batch stats.
- **Broken output port and shutdown timeout** — Batch mixin now crashes on broken output ports and respects shutdown timeout instead of silently continuing.
- **Purge grade updates wrapped individually** — Prevents stale grades after partial payload deletion.
- **Absent finish_reason accepted** — LLM responses with no `finish_reason` field (distinct from non-STOP values) are now accepted; Azure batch file ID guards added.
- **Per-query templates pre-compiled at init** — Separates structural errors (config, caught at startup) from operational errors (per-row, caught at render).
- **Coalesce `_completed_keys` for late arrivals** — Late-arriving tokens after resume are now correctly detected via completed-keys tracking.
- **Route-label enforcement at construction** — Moved from runtime lookup to DAG construction time; `get_route_label()` simplified.
- **`select_branch` KeyError wrapped** — Now raises `GraphValidationError` with context instead of bare `KeyError`.
- **`_get_node()` extracted in AggregationExecutor** — Unifies node validation, removes dead code.

#### Type Design

- **22 type-design bugs fixed** — 14 across engine, contracts, and plugins; 8 across engine, landscape, plugins, and verifier. Tightened field types, added missing validation, removed dead fields.
- **Checkpoint and call_data contracts hardened** — Type design improvements in checkpoint and call_data contract types.

#### Logging & Telemetry

- **stdlib logging → structlog** — Replaced in batch mixin, multi_query, azure_blob_source, and azure_batch.
- **Telemetry emitted before null-content raise** — Telemetry events are now emitted before raising on null-content LLM responses, closing an observability gap.
- **Journal payload load errors caught** — Journal now catches and translates `PayloadNotFoundError` and `OSError` from payload store with diagnostic context.
- **LLM finish-reason fail-closed** — Restructured `_finish_reason_error` from blocklist to allowlist (accept only `STOP` and absent). Unknown finish reasons now rejected as non-retryable errors.
- **Shutdown checkpoint skip logging** — `_checkpoint_interrupted_progress` emits structured `shutdown_checkpoint_skipped` warning with diagnostic context instead of silently returning.
- **Schema epoch directional guard** — `_sync_sqlite_schema_epoch` raises `SchemaCompatibilityError` on future epochs instead of silently downgrading.
- **Checkpoint recovery type annotation** — `_get_buffered_checkpoint_token_ids` parameter typed as `Checkpoint` instead of `Any`.
- **SQLite read-only audit inspection** — `LandscapeDB.from_url(..., create_tables=False)` no longer stamps `PRAGMA user_version`, preserving forensic access.

#### Test Infrastructure (ChaosLLM/ChaosWeb)

- **Malformed header overrides** — ChaosLLM and ChaosWeb now handle malformed header overrides gracefully instead of crashing the test server.
- **ChaosLLM template pre-compilation** — Templates pre-compiled at init for faster test execution.
- **Flaky purge test fixed** — `test_grade_update_failures_logged` used `capsys` which is unreliable when prior tests reconfigure structlog; switched to `structlog.testing.capture_logs()`.

### Changed

- `isinstance` allowlist compacted from flat entries into per-file rules with `max_hits` caps
- Code review findings remediated — frozen field access, `deep_thaw` frozenset, DTO validation

### Added

- **Agentic code threat model discussion paper** — Comprehensive research paper covering forward analysis for agentic security, control strength hierarchy, incentive misalignment analysis, ISM control citations, and ACF framework. Multiple revisions through v0.3 with LaTeX build pipeline and DTA brand guidelines.
- **`PayloadNotFoundError`** — Domain exception in `PayloadStore` protocol, replacing generic `KeyError` for missing payload lookups.
- **`CallDataResult` discriminated type** — Replaces ambiguous `None` returns from Azure client data operations.
- DAG validation tests for route-label and sink-map invariants
- Coalesce checkpoint unit tests for `_get_buffered_checkpoint_token_ids` and `restore_from_checkpoint` rejection paths

### Removed

- Dead lifecycle hooks, stale comments, unused imports across engine and plugins
- Dead code and process-tracking comments in ChaosLLM and ChaosWeb
- Dead code, tombstone comments, and process-tracking prefixes across codebase

### Tests

- 6 P0 mutation survivors killed across canonical, lineage, tokens, triggers, and coalesce
- 15 P1 mutation survivors killed across topology, lineage, tokens, triggers, coalesce, payload, exporter, executors, and outcomes
- 9 test-gap bugs closed with 25 new tests across executors, coalesce, DAG, sinks, and plugins
- 2 remaining test-gap bugs closed — purge command and MCP analyzer queries

## [0.3.3] (RC-3.3 — Architectural Remediation)

4-phase remediation sprint driven by full architecture analysis. Focus: audit integrity hardening, layer enforcement, and elimination of defensive-pattern violations.

### T10: LLM Plugin Consolidation

Collapsed 6 LLM transform classes (~4,950 lines) into a unified `LLMTransform` with provider dispatch, eliminating ~3,300 lines of duplication. Strategy pattern: `LLMProvider` protocol handles transport (Azure SDK vs OpenRouter HTTP), two processing strategies (`SingleQueryStrategy` / `MultiQueryStrategy`) handle row logic, shared `LangfuseTracer` handles tracing.

- Extracted shared infrastructure: `LangfuseTracer` (~600 lines deduplicated), `PromptTemplate` system, validation utilities
- Created `LLMProvider` protocol with `AzureLLMProvider` and `OpenRouterLLMProvider` implementations
- Single plugin registration: `plugin: llm` + `provider: azure|openrouter`; old names raise `ValueError` with migration guidance
- Deleted 5 old source files, updated 16 example YAMLs and 10 documentation files

### T17: PluginContext Protocol Split

Decomposed the god-object `PluginContext` (20+ fields) into 4 phase-based protocols in `contracts/contexts.py` — `SourceContext`, `TransformContext`, `SinkContext`, `LifecycleContext` — narrowing each plugin method signature to only the fields that pipeline phase actually needs. Concrete `PluginContext` structurally satisfies all 4 protocols; engine executors mutate concrete fields between steps while plugins see read-only views via protocol typing. 23 plugin files updated.

### T18: Orchestrator/Processor Decomposition

Pure extract-method refactoring of the two largest engine files, reducing maximum method size to ≤150 lines with no behavior change. Extracted 7 methods from `orchestrator/core.py` and 3 from `processor.py`. Introduced typed parameter bundles (`GraphArtifacts`, `RunContext`, `LoopContext`) and discriminated union types for transform/gate outcomes.

### T19: Landscape Repository Pattern

Refactored `LandscapeRecorder` from 8 mixins into 4 composed domain repositories — `RunLifecycleRepository`, `ExecutionRepository`, `DataFlowRepository`, `QueryRepository` — split by pipeline-phase domain. `LandscapeRecorder` is now a pure delegation facade (~91 public methods, zero logic).

### Plugins Restructure (SDA Alignment)

Reorganized the flat `plugins/` directory into 4 SDA-aligned subfolders: `infrastructure/` (shared base classes, clients, batching, pooling), `sources/`, `transforms/`, `sinks/`. 247 files changed, ~200 imports rewritten.

### Protocol Relocation (L3→L0)

Moved `SourceProtocol`, `TransformProtocol`, `SinkProtocol`, `BatchTransformProtocol`, and `GateResult` from `plugins/infrastructure/` (L3) to `contracts/` (L0). Eliminates the engine→plugins layer violation that forced L2 code to import from L3.

### Fixed

- **Pending coalesce resume gaps** — Added typed coalesce checkpoint DTOs, persisted pending coalesce state in checkpoint records, restored coalesce barriers on resume, and taught recovery to exclude buffered coalesce tokens from replay. Graceful shutdown can now resume fork/join pipelines without losing pending joins or replaying already-buffered rows.
- **Interrupted resume checkpoint ordering** — Resumed runs now rebase checkpoint sequence numbers from the previous resume point before writing fresh checkpoints, so a second interrupted resume continues from the newest durable progress marker instead of falling back to an older checkpoint.
- **SQLite schema compatibility posture** — Replaced the ad hoc `checkpoints.coalesce_state_json` required-column gate with an explicit SQLite schema epoch stamp via `PRAGMA user_version`, preserving intentional pre-1.0 schema breaks while keeping a clear future migration seam.
- **Buffered-only resume shutdown semantics** — Resume now honors a pre-set shutdown signal before any end-of-source aggregation/coalesce flushes, so buffered-only checkpoints are re-checkpointed for another resume instead of being flushed to sinks.
- **Frozen audit records** — Added `frozen=True, slots=True` to all 16 mutable audit record dataclasses in `contracts/audit.py`. Mutations now crash at the mutation site instead of silently corrupting the Tier 1 audit trail.
- **FrameworkBugError/AuditIntegrityError re-raise** — Added explicit re-raise before all broad `except Exception` handlers (13 sites across 7 files). System-level errors now always propagate. Structural AST test enforces bare `raise` pattern at all 17 guard sites.
- **Silent failure remediation** — Comprehensive review of error handling across LLM plugins and plugin infrastructure. Silent fallbacks converted to proper exceptions or `TransformResult.error()` with diagnostic context. Missing optional packages now raise `RuntimeError` with install instructions instead of silently degrading.
- **azure_batch silent passthrough** — `_process_single` else branch now raises `RuntimeError` instead of silently passing through unprocessed rows as "processed", matching the hardened pattern in `openrouter_batch`.
- **Assert removal** — Replaced 18 `assert` statements across 10 plugin files with explicit `if/raise RuntimeError`. Asserts are stripped by `python -O`, silently removing safety checks.
- **Truthiness checks** — Fixed 21 `if x:` / `x or default` patterns across 8 files that silently excluded valid zero values and empty strings. All replaced with explicit `is not None` checks.
- **LLM transform bugs** — Fixed limiter dispatch using wrong config attribute, `response_format` not passed to provider, `output_fields` not extracted from multi-query responses, NaN/Infinity not rejected in LLM JSON responses
- **Layer violations resolved** — Moved `ExpressionParser` from `engine/` to `core/`, `MaxRetriesExceeded` and `BufferEntry` to `contracts/`, created `RuntimeServiceRateLimit` in `contracts/config/`. 10 upward import violations → 0.
- **OpenRouter parallel query client race** — Parallel multi-query runs shared a cached `AuditedHTTPClient` by `state_id`; first query to finish destroyed the transport for siblings. Added reference counting so client closes only when last query releases it.
- **Aggregation BUFFERED lifecycle gap** — Triggering token on count-threshold flush skipped `BUFFERED` and went directly to terminal. Moved `BUFFERED` recording before `should_flush()` check so every aggregation token follows `BUFFERED` → terminal.
- **BatchReplicate quarantine audit gap** — Buffer-time recording changed from `CONSUMED_IN_BATCH` (terminal) to `BUFFERED` (non-terminal) for transform-mode aggregation, enabling per-token `QUARANTINED` recording when batch transforms quarantine individual rows.
- **KeywordFilter fail-closed on non-string values** — Security transform was silently passing non-string values in explicitly configured fields (fail-open). Now returns error with `reason='non_string_field'`.
- **Multi-query regressions from T10** — Restored field type validation against declared `output_fields` type/enum constraints; restored pooled execution with AIMD capacity backoff; fixed Pydantic schema missing `output_fields`; fixed `_output_schema_config` using unprefixed single-query fields.
- **LLM empty/whitespace content detection** — Azure and OpenRouter providers now raise `ContentPolicyError` for empty or whitespace-only content before `LLMQueryResult` construction.
- **LLM content-filter finish reason fail-open** — Unified single-query and multi-query `LLMTransform` paths now treat `finish_reason=content_filter` as `reason='content_filtered'` instead of recording provider-filtered fallback text as successful output.
- **Telemetry/Landscape hash divergence** — Telemetry hashes now read from recorded `Call` object instead of recomputing independently, eliminating divergence for datetime/Decimal/bytes/numpy payloads.
- **URL password fingerprint encoding** — Fingerprinting now decodes percent-encoding before HMAC, so fingerprint represents the actual secret, not the URL-encoded form.
- **TUI coalesce error crash on older records** — `_validate_coalesce_error` crashed with `KeyError` on pre-RC3.3 records. Added schema shape detection; older records render with degraded-format note.
- **Graceful shutdown end-of-source synthesis** — Interrupted runs no longer force `END_OF_SOURCE` aggregation flushes or resolve pending coalesces just because shutdown arrived after the current row.
- **Graceful shutdown resumability for buffered pipelines** — Interrupted aggregation/coalesce runs now persist a shutdown checkpoint before raising, so buffered state remains resumable even when no sink token was written yet.
- **CLI explain passphrase silently swallowed** (T4) — YAML parse errors when `--settings` was explicitly provided now exit with code 1 and clear error message.
- **MCP `diagnose()` quarantine count unscoped** (T5) — Was counting all historical runs; now scoped to last 24 hours, matching "what's broken right now?" purpose.
- **ChaosLLM MCP CLI broken** (T27) — Called nonexistent `serve()` instead of `run_server()`, masked by `# type: ignore` comments.
- **Azure AI tracing silent no-op** — Wired `_configure_azure_monitor()` into `LLMTransform.on_start()` with provider compatibility validation (Azure-only); replaced broad `except TypeError` with explicit `None` check so real SDK errors propagate.
- **Contract-level fixes** — `Token.run_id` false optional removed; `CoalesceFailureReason` TypedDict replaced with frozen dataclass (3 dead fields deleted, 4 fields made required); dead `version` parameter removed from `stable_hash()`; Call XOR invariant (`state_id` vs `operation_id`) now enforced at construction; `RawCallPayload.to_dict()` returns shallow copy per immutability contract; `SanitizedDatabaseUrl` rewrote DSN handling to use `urllib.parse` (keeping `contracts/` a leaf layer).
- **Code review remediation** — 4 critical (provider key validation split, `REPR_FALLBACK` row data state, `AuditIntegrityError` in `ExecutionError.from_dict()`, type-narrow `_convert_retryable_to_error_result`), 8 important, 6 suggestion fixes.
- **CI/CD failures resolved** — ruff lint/format, mypy stale `type: ignore`, contracts allowlist, tier model (31 stale fingerprints refreshed).

### Changed

- Extracted `contracts/hashing.py` — primitive-only `canonical_json`, `stable_hash`, and `repr_hash` (RFC 8785 + hashlib, no pandas/numpy). Breaks circular dependency between `contracts/` and `core/canonical.py`.
- Aggregation `on_error` is now required for aggregation transforms
- DTO mapper classes renamed from `*Repository` to `*Loader` to avoid confusion with new domain repositories
- **Test infrastructure overhaul (P0.5a–P4)** — 6-phase systematic hardening of the test suite, eliminating brittle coupling to internal constructors:
  - P0.5a–b: New factories (`make_recorder_with_run()`, `register_test_node()`, etc.) and refactored existing factories to delegate through them
  - P1: Replaced ~350 direct `PluginContext(...)` constructions across 53 files with centralized `make_context()` factory
  - P2: Replaced ~452 inline `LandscapeDB.in_memory()`/`LandscapeRecorder(...)` constructions across 76 files with factory calls. Net −715 lines
  - P3: Replaced ~529 lines of duplicated inline test plugin classes across 10 files with shared `tests.fixtures.plugins` imports
  - P4: Re-raise guards in telemetry/orchestrator/operation tracking, frozen evidence types (`ExceptionResult`, `FailureInfo`), aggregation DRY via `accumulate_row_outcomes()` + `ExecutionCounters`
- Resolved all 401 mypy errors across test suite — removed ~74 stale `# type: ignore` comments, added union-type narrowing guards, fixed module re-exports, wrapped `NewType` constructors, fixed protocol signatures (103 files)
- `PluginBundle` frozen dataclass replaces `dict[str, Any]` return from `instantiate_plugins_from_config()`, enabling mypy checking on all access sites
- Fingerprint primitives (`get_fingerprint_key()`, `secret_fingerprint()`) moved to `contracts/security.py` as stdlib-only implementations
- Redundant `.value` on `StrEnum` usage removed across checkpoint, landscape repositories, MCP, and tests
- Removed file-path header comments from 128 source files
- Azure safety transform consolidation (T14) — extracted shared batch infrastructure into `BaseAzureSafetyTransform` and `safety_utils.py`

### Added

- Typed coalesce checkpoint contracts (`CoalesceCheckpointState`, `CoalescePendingCheckpoint`, `CoalesceTokenCheckpoint`) plus CLI resume visibility for whether a checkpoint carries coalesce state
- **ADR-006**: Layer Dependency Remediation — documents the strict 4-layer model and CI enforcement strategy
- Full architecture analysis (23 documents covering all 13 subsystems)
- **Security posture brief** — Comprehensive document covering threat model, security controls, assurance evidence, and residual risk for ELSPETH v0.3.0
- **TYPE_CHECKING layer import detection** — `enforce_tier_model.py` CI gate now detects `TYPE_CHECKING` imports crossing layer boundaries as allowlistable findings
- **MCP server `_ToolDef` registry** replacing if/elif dispatch chain (T15)
- ~150 new tests across hardening, code review, and infrastructure phases

### Removed

- Dead code: `BaseLLMTransform` (3,473 lines, zero subclasses), `RequestRecord` dataclass, `TokenManager.payload_store` parameter, `populate_run()` (raw SQL bypass of `LandscapeRecorder`), LLM validation utilities (`render_template_safe`, `check_truncation`)
- ~21 low-value tests (vacuous assertions, mock-testing, implementation coupling)
- Superseded aggregation helpers replaced by shared `accumulate_row_outcomes()`

### Tests

- Full suite: approximately 10,500 tests — mypy/ruff/contracts all clean
- P0.5a–P4 test infrastructure overhaul: centralized factories, shared fixtures, eliminated ~1,700 lines of duplicated test boilerplate
