# No Bug-Hiding Enforcement Configuration
#
# This file configures the no_bug_hiding static analysis tool.
# It detects defensive programming patterns that hide bugs instead of fixing them.
#
# Philosophy:
#   - Inside the tent: fail fast, no patterns that mask bugs
#   - At boundaries: explicit validation allowed, but must be intentional and documented
#
# Key format: <file_path>:<rule_id>:<symbol_context>:line=<lineno>
#
# Rules:
#   R1: dict.get() usage - hides missing key bugs
#   R2: getattr() with default - hides missing attribute bugs
#   R3: hasattr() usage - branches around missing attributes
#   R4: broad exception handling without re-raise - suppresses bugs

version: 1

defaults:
  # Fail CI if an allowlist entry doesn't match any code (stale entry)
  fail_on_stale: true
  # Fail CI if an allowlist entry has expired

  # These display Landscape data that may be incomplete for failed/partial
