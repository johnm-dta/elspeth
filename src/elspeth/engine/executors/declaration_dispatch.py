"""Declaration-contract runtime dispatcher (ADR-010 §Decision 3 + §Semantics).

Adopts **audit-complete with aggregation** posture per ADR-010 §Semantics. On a (row,
call-site) tuple that would violate multiple registered contracts, the
dispatcher DOES NOT short-circuit on the first violation — it collects every
contract's raised audit-evidence exception, attaches dispatcher attribution
to each DCV child, and at loop end:

    * 0 violations → return normally.
    * 1 violation  → raise ``violations[0]`` via reference equality
                     (N6 regression invariant at N=1 — the raise MUST be
                     identity-preserving, NOT an aggregation-of-one wrapper).
    * >=2          → wrap in ``AggregateDeclarationContractViolation`` and
                     raise.

Rationale (see ADR-010 §Semantics amendment):

> ELSPETH's CLAUDE.md "Auditability Standard" makes "I don't know what
> happened" structurally impermissible for any output. Under fail-fast
> first-fire semantics, the audit trail's silence on a second contract's
> evaluation is indistinguishable from "checked and passed" — a Repudiation
> surface (STRIDE) the auditor cannot resolve. Under audit-complete, every
> applicable contract's method runs; every violation is recorded; absence
> in the audit trail means "checked and passed," not "skipped because an
> earlier contract fired."

Four public dispatch sites (H2 §Fix direction):

    * ``run_pre_emission_checks(inputs)`` — before transform.process().
    * ``run_post_emission_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — after process().
    * ``run_batch_flush_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — batch-flush TRANSFORM mode.
    * ``run_boundary_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — source / sink boundary (2C).

A single shared helper (``_dispatch``) implements the collect-then-raise
pattern once; each public function is a thin site-tagged wrapper. This
satisfies F2 §Acceptance "single shared helper with the post-emission
dispatcher, not parallel implementation" — the four sites share ONE
orchestration body.

Catch scope (see ``_dispatch``):

    * ``DeclarationContractViolation`` — the required audit-evidence base for
      every declaration adopter. Registration rejects contracts wired to
      legacy non-DCV exception families so future adopters fail loudly instead
      of bypassing dispatcher attribution.

Non-audit-evidence exceptions (plugin bugs raising arbitrary exceptions
from ``applies_to`` or the dispatch method) propagate UNMODIFIED per the
CLAUDE.md plugin-ownership posture — a buggy contract is a framework bug
that must crash.
